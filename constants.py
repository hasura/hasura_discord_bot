These are all the commands you can use with this bot.

`/hello`
This is a health-check, it should respond with "Hello World!".

`/collections`
This will list the collections available to search. Searching a collection is similar to performing a Google search!

`/search`
The search command takes 2 required parameters and 1 optional parameter.

* query: The query parameter is the search query, this is where you type your question
    
* collection: This is the document collection to search
    
* limit: This optional parameter defaults to 10, but can go up to 100 to return more or less results.


`/solve`
This can be used by a member of the staff to mark a question as being solved. The author of a thread can also vote with a ‚úÖ on the question to mark it as solved.

`/unsolve`
This can be used by a member of the staff to mark a question as being unsolved. Sometimes answers might need updated.

`/close`
This can be used by a member of the staff to close a thread. Either to archive old threads, or for off-topic questions.

`/open`
This can be used by a member of the staff to re-open a closed thread. 

`/status`
This shows the status of the thread it is posted in.
